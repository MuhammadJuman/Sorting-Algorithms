Sorting Algorithms

This is a GUI program that show runtime for different sorting algorithms in nanoseconds. The program generates random numbers and the user chooses different sorting algorithms at each run time and compare their run time.

The program was written on Netbeans, Windows 7 and Updated on Eclipse, Mac OSX Yosemite. The GUI was built with a GUI builder.

Running the program
  To run the program, download it and copy the file to new project in Eclipse or Netbeans, compile, then run. Remember to (re)name the package correctly.

Sorting algorithms implemented
   - Bubble sort
   - Selection sort
   - Insertion sort
   - Quick sort
   - Merge sort
   - Heap sort

* Try to add a large set of generated number to see a good difference of these algorithms effectiveness.
